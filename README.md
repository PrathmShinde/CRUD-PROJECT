## CRUD_Project

CRUD operations in Angular
In this project i did CRUD operations in angular. i stored data in JSON format By using json-server 

after downloading this zip file, you need to install angular material in this project by using below command
## ng add @angular/material

Also for json, you need to install npm packages of json. By following commands you can install json pakages
## npm i -g json-server 

After that you have to start json-server by using below command (It will create db.json file)
## json-server --watch db.json

Add below empty array in db.json file
# "employee": [] 

your data will be stored in this array in the json format(key:value) pairs

For your reference, I have attached a json file with this source code. 
Put this json file outside the src folder and inside the project folder.
